Mango Lassi courtesy http://www.rachnas-kitchen.com/mango-lassi-recipe/

INGREDIENTS
------------
¾ cup plain low-fat yogurt or full fat yogurt
1 cup fresh mango pulp
1½ tablespoons sugar or adjust to taste
¼ teaspoon cardamom powder (optional)
1 teaspoon rose water or 7-8 drops of Kewra water (optional)
3 ice cubes
Glazed cherries (chopped) for garnish(optional)

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1) Peel the mango and take the mango flesh out.
2) Put mango flesh and sugar in a blender. Blend it till you get smooth puree. It will take around 1 or 2 minutes.
3) Add rose water or kewra water. I used kewra as I love to use it in my recipes. Add cardamom powder and ice cubes. Blend for 30 seconds or till everything combines well.
4) Mango Lassi is ready. The texture of this Lassi is bit thick and creamy. But if you need to thin it slightly, add milk and whizz up.
5) Pour mango Lassi in glasses and garnish with glazed cherry. Serve it chilled.
