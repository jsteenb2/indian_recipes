INGREDIENTS
------------
1 cup all purpose flour
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1½ teaspoon baking soda
A pinch of salt
1½ tablespoon oil
1½ cup homemade sour yogurt
Water as required
Nigella seeds or sesame seeds to scatter on top of bread (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1) Step 1. In a large mixing bowl add both flour, salt, baking soda, oil and yogurt.
2) Step 2. Mix everything and add water slowly to knead a smooth soft dough.
3) Step 3. Knead the dough till it becomes soft and stretchy. To knead the dough I used dough kneader machine so it took 4 minutes to get it ready. By hand it will take around 10 - 12 minutes. Once it is done, let it rest for 15 - 30 minutes.
4) Step 4. When ready to cook, divide the dough into 8 -9 equal balls and press them lightly to make small discs. Take one disc, sprinkle some nigella seeds or sesame seeds on top and start rolling into oval shape. While rolling naan, make sure that you don't press too much else it will not puff very well.
5) Step 5. Heat a skillet (tawa) on medium heat. At the same time brush water on the opposite side of naan where nigella seeds are sticking.
6) Step 6. Place the wet side of naan gently on skillet and immediately cover it with a lid. With in 30 - 40 seconds naan will start to puff up.
7) Step 8. Flip the side and cook it for another 40 seconds. Brown patches starts to appear on naan.
8) Once done. Drizzle ghee or butter over naan and keep them covered in aluminium foil till serve.
