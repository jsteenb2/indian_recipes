INGREDIENTS
------------
1 pound (450 grams) boneless chicken thighs cut into cubes
¼ cup rice vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ teaspoon salt
7 whole black peppercorns
1 bay leaf
2 cardamom pods
7 dried red finger chilies
7 whole cloves
2 fresh hot green chiles, roughly chopped
7 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (1/2 inch) piece of fresh ginger, roughly chopped
1 Tablespoon tamarind paste
2 Tablespoons vegetable oil or clarified butter
2 red onions, finely diced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
Salt to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1) Marinating
2) Marinate chicken by adding above six ingredients chicken cubes, rice vinegar, ground cumin, turmeric powder and salt in a mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Marinate chicken for at least 30 minutes. If you are not in hurry, marinate for longer as it will add more taste.
3) Prepare vindaloo curry powder
4) Place a pan over medium flame. Add next 5 ingredients whole black peppercorns, bay leaf, cardamom pods, dried red finger chilies, whole cloves and dry roast them for about 1 minute.
5) Now put all the roasted ingredients in a grinder and grind to a fine powder.
6) Prepare spice paste
7) In a grinder or blender add garlic, green chilies, ginger, tamarind and cinnamon powder. Blend mixture to a smooth paste.
8) Cooking chicken
9) Place a pan over medium heat. Add two tablespoon of oil (I prefer ghee). Add the chopped onions. I like to use chopped onion instead of onion paste because sometime paste turns curry taste bitter.
10) Saute till onion caramalize or changes colour to golden brown.
11) Add spice paste prepared in step 3. Saute for 1 minute.
12) Add dry vindaloo curry powder prepared from step 2. Saute again for 20 seconds.
13) Add chicken cubes and saute.
14) Add salt to taste. Remember that we added salt previously while marinating so adjust salt quantity.
15) Add ¼ cup water and cover the lid. Let the chicken simmer on low heat until it's cooked. It will take 8 to 10 minutes.
16) Chicken vindaloo is ready to serve. You can serve it with naan ,chapati or plain basmati rice.
