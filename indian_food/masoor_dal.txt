INGREDIENTS
------------
For pressure cooking
1 Cup Masoor dal/Red lentils
2 small-sized tomato, roughly chopped
½ Teaspoon turmeric powder
½ Teaspoon red chili powder
2¼ cup water
Salt to taste
For tempering
2 Tablespoon ghee or vegetable oil
1 Teaspoon cumin seeds
A pinch of asafoetida
2 Teaspoon garlic, finely chopped
2 Whole red chili
1 Onion, chopped
1 Tablespoon Coriander leaves, chopped
Few sprigs of coriander, for garnish(optional)

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1) Cooking daal (red lentils)
2) Rinse daal in running water. In a pressure cooker add lentils, chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder and salt to taste. Add 2¼ cup water. Cover the lid and pressure cook it around 8- 10 minutes or up to 3 whistles.
3) If you don't want to cook dal in pressure cooker, use deep pot with a lid having hole passage to escape steam. Put the dal and other recommended ingredients along with 3 cups of water. 6. Stir and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, close with a lid and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until cooked. Once dal is cooked, mush it little by stirring with a spatula. Keep it aside.
4) Preparing tempering
5) In a different pan, heat up ghee or oil on medium heat. Add cumin seeds. Once they splutter, add chopped garlic and saute till they change colour to golden brown. Add whole chilies, stir for 10 seconds. Add chopped onions and saute till becomes golden in colour.
6) Mixing daal into tempering
7) Once tadka (tempering) is ready, pour cooked dal (lentils) in the pan and mix them. Add required water to adjust consistency (I added 1 cup of water). Put the lid on pan and simmer the mixture on low heat for 8- 10 minutes. Turn off the flame. Lastly add chopped coriander leaves and cover the pan with lid. Masoor dal recipe is ready. Garnish it with coriander leaves and serve it with basmati rice or chapati/phulka.
