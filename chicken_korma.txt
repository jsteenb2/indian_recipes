4) Preparing Korma Sauce
5) In a large saucepan heat 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and cloves (lavang) to crackle. Then add asafoetida, saute for 30 seconds. Add the chopped garlic and ginger, saute for 30 seconds. Then add onion and cook for a 2- 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until it turns to golden brown in color.
6) Step 4. Once onion is cooked, add turmeric, 2 teaspoons curry powder, ¾ teaspoon garam masala, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, ¼ teaspoon black pepper, ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, ½ teaspoon ground cardamom and ¼ teaspoon nutmeg powder. Saute mixture for about 1 minute on low heat. Be careful that spices shouldn't burn at this point. Turn off the heat.
7) Step 5. Let the mixture cool down. Blend the mixture in a blender till it turns to smooth consistency.
8) Now pour the mixture into cooked chicken pan (in step 2). Place the pan on low heat.
9) Add the full can of coconut milk and yogurt. Stir it continuously for 1 or 2 minute on low heat so that yogurt doesn't get split. Now increase heat to bring boil to the mixture.
10) Add brown sugar and 2 teaspoon almond powder.
11) Lastly add salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes and turn off the gas. You can adjust the consistency by increasing water or decreasing by simmering for few more minutes.
12) Chicken korma is ready to serve with naan, chapati or rice.
